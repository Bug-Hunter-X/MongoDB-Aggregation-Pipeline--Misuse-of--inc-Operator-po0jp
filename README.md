# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Bug: Incorrect Use of $inc Operator

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the MongoDB aggregation pipeline: incorrectly applying the `$inc` operator.  The `$inc` operator is intended for update operations, not for modifying results within the aggregation pipeline.  This example shows the incorrect usage and provides a corrected solution.

## Problem
The provided code attempts to increment the `count` field in the aggregation pipeline using `$inc`. This will result in an error because `$inc` is not a valid operator within the `$group` or other aggregation stages.

## Solution
The solution involves correctly incorporating the increment into the aggregation pipeline's logic, typically within the `$group` stage itself using `$sum`.
